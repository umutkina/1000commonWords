              I am an adult. I\'m not a kid. I\'m a grown-up. I need some money. I have no food. I am hungry. I am not thirsty, because water is everywhere. But water has no taste. I want to drink a soda. I want to drink milk. I want to drink coffee. I want to work. Nobody will hire me. Nobody is hiring anybody. Companies are firing people. Companies are laying off people. Everyone is looking for a job. I cannot pay my rent. I will have to live in my car. I don\'t want to live in my car. My car has no bed. Everyone should live in a house or an apartment. Many people don\'t have a car. They live on the street. A street has no bed. Nobody should live on the street. I don\'t know what to do. I don\'t know where to go. Maybe I will go to church. Maybe I will find help there.

He looked at his watch. It was time for the bus. Where was the bus? He was at the bus stop. He stood up. He looked down the street. No bus. He looked up the street. No bus. Where in the world was the bus? It was time for the bus to arrive. He sat down on the bench. It was getting cold. The wind was blowing. He didn\'t have a jacket. He was wearing shorts. He was wearing flip-flops. His head was cold. His arms were cold. His legs were cold. His feet were cold. His toes were cold. His toes were turning blue. Where was the bus? He stood up again. He looked down the street. He saw the bus! It was coming. In a minute he would be on the warm bus. In a minute his nose would be warm. His hands would be warm. His whole body would be warm. How nice! The bus arrived. But it didn\'t stop. It kept going. It was the wrong bus. He looked at his watch again. Where was the bus?

Peter goes to a doctor. “Doctor, I have a problem,” he says. “When I sleep in my bed, I think that there is somebody under my bed. I look under my bed and I think there is somebody on my bed. On, under, on, under. I think that I am crazy!”
The doctor thinks for one minute. Then he says, “Come to me for 2 years. Come here three times in a week and I will help you.”
“How much will I pay?” Peter asks.
“One hundred dollars for a visit,” the doctor says.
Peter says, “I will think about it.”
Peter never comes back. After two weeks, he meets the doctor on the street.
“Why didn’t you come to visit me?” the doctor asks.
“One hundred dollars for one visit? It is expensive for me. A barman helped me for 10 dollars.”
The doctor doesn’t understand, “What did he do with you?”
“He told me to cut the legs of the bed.”

Let us enjoy reading this Zen Tale of A Handful of Answers.

        A young student of Zen was going to the market to buy vegetables for the monastery where he was studying. On the way he met a student from another monastery.

        “Where are you going?” asked the first student.

        “Wherever my legs take me,” replied the other.

        The first student pondered over the answer as he was sure it had some deep significance.

        When he returned to the monastery, he reported the conversation to his teacher, who said: “You should have asked him what he would do if he had no legs.”

        The next day the student was thrilled to see the same boy coming towards him.

        “Where are you going?” he asked and without waiting for a reply continued, “Wherever your legs take you, I suppose. Well, let me ask you . . .”

        “You’re mistaken,” interrupted the other boy. “Today I’m going wherever the wind blows.”

        This answer so confused the first boy that he could not think of anything to say.

        When he reported the matter to his teacher, the old man said: “You should have asked him what he would do if there were no wind.”

        Some days later the student saw the boy in the market again and rushed to confront him, confident that this time he would have the last word.

        “Where are you going?” he asked. “Wherever your legs take you or wherever the wind blows? Well, let me ask you . . . . ”

        “No, no,” interrupted the boy. “Today I’m going to buy vegetables.”

       <item>Once while traveling, Raman found himself in the company of a group of soldiers.

        They were all veterans of war and soon they got to talking about their experiences on the battlefield. One old soldier told of the time he had single-handedly slain seven enemy soldiers. Another gave a detailed description of the manner in which he had held an entire enemy battalion at bay.

        When they had finished they looked condescendingly at Raman.

        "I don\'t suppose you have any adventure worth telling," said one of the grizzled warriors.

        "Oh, but I have," said Rama

        "You have?!" said the soldiers.

        "Yes," said Rama. "Once while traveling I chanced upon a large tent. I entered and there, lying on a mat was the largest man I had ever seen. I recognized him at once as a dreaded dacoit who had been terrorizing that part of the country for years!"

        "What did you do?" asked the soldiers, their interest now fully aroused.

        "I cut off his toe and ran for dear life," said Rama.

        "His toe?" said a soldier. "Why toe? You should have cut off his head while you had the chance!"

        "Somebody had already done that," said Rama, grinning.

 Let us enjoy reading this Raman Story of Rama Climbs Out of Trouble .

        Tenali Raman once incurred the displeasure of the king, and the monarch ordered him to quit his dominions.

        Some days later as the king was riding through a forest, he saw a man, who on seeing the king, promptly climbed up a tree.

        The king stopped under the tree and looking up saw that it was Tenali Raman.

        "You are still here!" he thundered. "Did l not tell you to leave my kingdom?"

        "You did, Your Majesty," said Raman.

        "Accordingly, I traveled all over the world, but wherever I went l learnt that l was still in your dominions. Now the only thing left for me to do is to go to Heaven, and as you can see l have already made a start in that direction."

        The king laughed and forgave the jester.

  Fool of the Year contest was open to all the courtiers of King Krishnadeva Raya.

        All the people looked forward to the event as the winner stood to gain a handsome prize of 5000 gold coins.

        The trouble was, Raman always won the contest.

        One year the other courtiers decided that he must be kept out of it and bribed his servant to lock him in his room to prevent him from reaching the palace in time for the event.

        Consequently Raman reached the palace after the contest was over and just as the name of the winner was about to be announced.

        Seeing Raman come in, the king asked him why he was so late.

        Raman told him he was in need of a hundred gold coins and had been engaged in trying to raise the amount.

        "If you had participated in the contest you might have won the prize money and your problem would have been solved,” said the king. "You\'ve behaved very foolishly."

        "I am a fool," said Raman.

        "You\'re the greatest fool I\'ve ever seen!" said the king.

        "That means I have won the contest!" said Raman. The king realized that he had made a slip but he was too proud to acknowledge it and to the chagrin of the other courtiers declared Raman the winner of Fool of the Year contest!

Nasruddin Hodja was tilling his patch of land when a hunter came riding up.

        “Hey, you!” said the man. “Did you see a boar run past?”

        “Yes,” replied Hodja.

        “Which way did it go?” demanded the man.

        Hodja pointed in the direction in which the boar had gone.

        The man rode away without a word of thanks but he was back within minutes.

        “No sign of it!” he said. “Are you sure it went that way?”

        “I am certain,” replied Hodja. “It went that way. Two years ago.”

Mulla Nasruddin once took up a job as a coachman and one day he had to drive his employer to a disreputable part of the town.

"Keep your eyes open," his employer advised him as he alighted from the coach at his destination. "This place is infested with thieves."

Some time later the man thought of checking on his new employee.

"Is everything all right? What are you doing now?" he shouted from a window of the house he had gone into.

"I\'m sitting here wondering what happens to a man\'s lap when he gets up," the Mulla shouted back.

A little later the employer again shouted from the window, "What are you doing now?!"

"I\'m wondering what happens to a fist when the fingers are unclenched," shouted Nasruddin.

His employer was impressed.

"My coachman is no ordinary fellow," he boasted to his hosts. "He is a philosopher!"

Half an hour later he again poked his head out of the window and shouted, "What are you doing now?"

"I am wondering who stole the horses," replied the Mulla

A horse race was about to be held and the contestants were being lined up. 

Mulla Nasruddin Hodja came with an ox and asked that it be included in the race. 

"Have you gone mad?" said the organizers. "What chance does an ox have against horses?" 

"You talk that way because you do not know anything about my ox," said Hodja. "When it was a mere calf it could run almost as fast as a pony. Now that it is older it should be able to run even faster."

Hodja once lived in a rented house.

The building was old and whenever there was a strong wind, its rafters would creak and squeak.

One day when the landlord came to collect the rent, Hodja told him about the alarming noises the building was making.

“Don’t let that worry you,” said the landlord, airily. “Those noises are nothing but the praises the old building is singing to the Almighty.”

“Oh, I’m not worried about the hymns,” said Hodja. “But what if it decided to kneel down and worship him?”

 Nasruddin Hodja took his donkey to the market place and sold it for 30 dinars.

        The man who bought it immediately put it up for auction.

        "Look at this fine animal!" he shouted to passersby. "Have you ever seen a better specimen of a donkey? See how clean and strong it is!"

        And he went on to list the many qualities of the animal. At the end of his sales talk a man said he would give 40 dinars for it.

        Another man offered 50. A third offered 55.

        Hodja who was watching was amazed at the interest everyone was showing in the donkey.

        "What a fool I was to think it an ordinary animal," thought Hodja. "It is an incomparable beast, one in a million..." He suddenly realized that the owner had received a good offer and was about to close the bidding.

        "75 dinars once..." said the man."75 dinars twice..."

        "80 dinars!" said Hodja.

A rich man showed Nasruddin Hodja the coffin he had got made for himself.

He wanted Hodja to admire the quality of the wood.

"What do you think of the carvings on the sides?" he asked Hodja. "Don\'t you think they are superb?"

Hodja nodded his head appreciatively.

"I insisted that the inside be lined with felt - the best felt material of course!" the man boasted.

"Of course," agreed Hodja.

"I wanted it to be perfect," the man went on. "Do you think anything is missing?"

"Yes," replied Hodja, "the occupant."

Once at a crossroad, Mulla Nasruddin Hodja saw a portly nobleman riding towards him. 

"I say, Mulla," said the man. "Which is the way to the palace?" 

"How did you know I was a Mulla?" asked Hodja. The nobleman had a habit of addressing every scholarly-looking man as "Mulla," which was a title given to learned men and meant master but he didn’t want to tell Hodja that. 

"How did I know?" he bragged. "Well, I’m a mind-reader, that’s how." 

"Pleased to meet you," said Hodja. "As to your question, read my mind and proceed."

Nasruddin Hodja was trying to raise a fire by blowing at the glowing embers of coal in the fireplace.

All he succeeded in doing was to produce a thick cloud of smoke that stung his eyes.

He put on his wife\'s cap to prevent the smoke from getting into his eyes and started blowing again.

This time flames leaped up from the coal.

"Ahha!" said Hodja. "So you too are afraid of my wife."

Nasruddin Hodja ferrying a scholar across a river said something ungrammatical to him.

"Have you never studied grammar?" asked the scholar.

"No," said Hodja.

"Then half your life has been wasted," said the scholar looking pityingly at him.

Sometime later Hodja turned to his passenger.

"Have you ever learnt to swim?" he asked.

"No," said the scholar.

"Then your whole life has been wasted," said Hodja. "We\'re sinking."

Nasruddin Hodja had a buffalo whose horns were set wide apart.

Hodja often felt an urge to sit on the animal\'s head between the horns, but never dared try it.

One day the animal came and sat down very near him. Hodja threw caution to the winds and seizing the horns swung himself into the space between them.

"Now I feel like a king on his throne!" he said exultantly to his wife.

The buffalo, startled by the sudden invasion of its privacy, got indignantly to its feet and jerked its head violently forward.

Hodja went sailing into the air and fell head foremost into a ditch.

"It doesn\'t matter," he said to his wife who came running to help him. "It\'s not the first time a king has lost his throne."

One day Hodja met an acquaintance in the street.

The man looked worried and Hodja asked him what was troubling him.

"I have this terrible dream," said the man. "Every night I dream there\'s a monster hiding under the bed. When I get up and look there\'s no one there. I can\'t sleep afterwards. I am on my way to the doctor\'s house now. He says he can cure me for a hundred dinars."

"A hundred dinars!" exclaimed Hodja. "I can rid you of your problem for five!"

The man immediately took out 5 dinars and gave them to Hodja.

"Now tell me what to do," said the man.

"The remedy is simple," said Hodja, pocketing the money.

"Saw off the legs of the bed."

Hodja had a dream.

A man knocked at his door and asked if he could spend the night in his house.

He said he would pay 10 gold coins for the privilege.

Hodja agreed and showed him to his room.

The next morning, the man thanked Hodja and began taking out gold coins from his purse.

He took out nine and stopped.

"You promised to give me ten!" shouted Hodja and awoke.

He looked around for the man but there was no one there.

He quickly shut his eyes again.

"All right all right," he said. "Give me nine!"

One day Hodja\'s neighbor asked him to write a letter for him.

"To whom do you want to write?" asked Hodja.

"To my friend in Baghdad," said the man.

"Sorry," said Hodja. "I have no time to go to Baghdad."

"Who is asking you to go to Baghdad!" asked his neighbor. "All I want you to do is write a letter for me!"

"I know," said Hodja. "But my handwriting is so bad that no one there will be able to read my writing and finally they will send for me. And as I\'ve told you I\'ve no time to go to Baghdad."

One evening, Nasruddin Hodja\'s wife saw her husband walking up and down the verandah in great agitation.

"What\'s the matter?" she asked him.

"I borrowed a hundred dinars from our neighbor last month and I promised to return the money on the last day of this month," explained Hodja.

"Tomorrow is the last day and I don\'t have the money. I don\'t know what to do."

"What is there to do!" said his wife. "Go and tell him you can\'t pay!"

Hodja took his wife\'s advice.

When he returned from his neighbor’s house he looked relaxed and happy.

"How did he take it?" asked his wife.

"Ah, well," said Hodja. "Now he is walking up and down his verandah.

ONE DAY a man said to Nasruddin, "I\'ve heard you\'ve got vinegar that is 40 years old."

"That is true," said Hodja.

"Will you give me some?" asked the man.

"If I gave vinegar to all those who asked, it wouldn\'t have become 40 years old," said Hodja.

Hodja, deep in thought was walking down a road near the palace when he bumped into a man. 

The man got very angry and began to curse and shout at Hodja. 

"Do you know who I am!" he screamed. "I am the king\'s Advisor!" 

"That is nice," said Hodja. "As for me I am a king." 

"A king?" asked the man. "Over which country do you rule?" 

"I rule over myself," said Hodja. "I am master of my passions. You would never find me losing my temper as you did just now." 

The man apologized and went away feeling very ashamed of himself.
